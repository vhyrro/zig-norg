  See also {https://github.com/max397574/rust-norg}, aka the rust version.

** Why?
   This parser will be crucial for the semantic analyzer in Neorg and
   for the Norg LSP, alongside {https://github.com/nvim-neorg/norg-fmt}[`norg-fmt`].
   Much epicness.

** Features
   - Parses 2/3's of layer 1
   - Parses headings
